                Architects design new structures into our world.<br>
                Coalescence means: the joining or merging of elements to form one mass or 
                whole.<br>
                Founded by Brian Bernard, musician by trade, philanthropist at heart. 
                Include minor biography. Let someone else write it or include just 
                historical facts. I don’t matter. The mission does.<br>
                <b>Socioeconomic Irrigation</b><br>    
                Ending poverty is within our grasp. It used to seem impossible to 
                guarantee that crops growing inland could receive their optimum amount of 
                water, sun, shade, and soil nutrition. This is something we take for 
                granted for how normal it is now.<br>
                Irrigation was invented between 6,000-3,100 BCE.<br>
                We have the same opportunity now, to make sure every human receives all 
                needs. AoC creates the structure to ensure that by viewing money as the 
                water we all need and then channeling it from abundant sources and 
                channeling it to fields of need.<br>
                Who knows what amazing beauty, innovation, creative endeavors, and joy we can collectively experience and appreciate if we had this structure and shift? I’m desperately curious to know. Let’s find out.
